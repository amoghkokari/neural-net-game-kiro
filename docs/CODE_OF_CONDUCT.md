# ü§ù Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We as members, contributors, and leaders pledge to make participation in our community a harassment-free experience for everyone, regardless of age, body size, visible or invisible disability, ethnicity, sex characteristics, gender identity and expression, level of experience, education, socio-economic status, nationality, personal appearance, race, caste, color, religion, or sexual identity and orientation.

We pledge to act and interact in ways that contribute to an open, welcoming, diverse, inclusive, and healthy community.

## Our Standards

### ‚úÖ Examples of behavior that contributes to a positive environment:

- **Being respectful** of differing opinions, viewpoints, and experiences
- **Giving and gracefully accepting** constructive feedback
- **Accepting responsibility** and apologizing to those affected by our mistakes, and learning from the experience
- **Focusing on what is best** not just for us as individuals, but for the overall community
- **Showing empathy** towards other community members
- **Using welcoming and inclusive language**
- **Being patient** with newcomers and those learning neural networks
- **Celebrating others' achievements** and learning milestones
- **Providing constructive help** when someone is struggling with concepts

### ‚ùå Examples of unacceptable behavior:

- Trolling, insulting or derogatory comments, and personal or political attacks
- Public or private harassment
- Publishing others' private information, such as a physical or email address, without their explicit permission
- Other conduct which could reasonably be considered inappropriate in a professional setting
- **Gatekeeping** or making others feel unwelcome based on their experience level
- **Dismissing questions** as "too basic" or "obvious"
- **Mocking learning difficulties** or different learning styles
- **Sharing solutions** without explanation, preventing learning

## Educational Community Values

As an educational project, we especially value:

### üéì Learning-First Mindset
- **No question is too basic** - everyone starts somewhere
- **Mistakes are learning opportunities** - we all learn by doing
- **Different learning styles** are welcomed and supported
- **Patience with beginners** is essential for community growth

### ü§ù Collaborative Learning
- **Share knowledge freely** while encouraging understanding
- **Explain concepts clearly** rather than just providing answers
- **Encourage experimentation** and hands-on learning
- **Celebrate progress** at every level

### üåü Inclusive Excellence
- **Welcome diverse backgrounds** in AI/ML learning
- **Support underrepresented groups** in technology
- **Make neural networks accessible** to all learners
- **Foster belonging** for everyone in the community

## Enforcement Responsibilities

Community leaders are responsible for clarifying and enforcing our standards of acceptable behavior and will take appropriate and fair corrective action in response to any behavior that they deem inappropriate, threatening, offensive, or harmful.

Community leaders have the right and responsibility to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, wiki edits, issues, and other contributions that are not aligned to this Code of Conduct, and will communicate reasons for moderation decisions when appropriate.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all community spaces, and also applies when an individual is officially representing the community in public spaces. Examples of representing our community include using an official e-mail address, posting via an official social media account, or acting as an appointed representative at an online or offline event.

## Enforcement

### Reporting Process

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported to the community leaders responsible for enforcement at:

- **Email**: conduct@neural-network-adventure.org
- **GitHub**: Private message to @maintainer-username
- **Discord**: Direct message to moderators

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

### What to Include in Reports

When reporting an incident, please include:

- **Your contact information** (so we can follow up)
- **Names of individuals involved** (including witnesses)
- **Description of the incident** (what happened)
- **Additional context** (screenshots, links, etc.)
- **Any previous incidents** with the same individuals

### Response Timeline

- **Acknowledgment**: Within 24 hours
- **Initial response**: Within 72 hours
- **Resolution**: Within 1 week for most cases

## Enforcement Guidelines

Community leaders will follow these Community Impact Guidelines in determining the consequences for any action they deem in violation of this Code of Conduct:

### 1. Correction

**Community Impact**: Use of inappropriate language or other behavior deemed unprofessional or unwelcome in the community.

**Consequence**: A private, written warning from community leaders, providing clarity around the nature of the violation and an explanation of why the behavior was inappropriate. A public apology may be requested.

### 2. Warning

**Community Impact**: A violation through a single incident or series of actions.

**Consequence**: A warning with consequences for continued behavior. No interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, for a specified period of time. This includes avoiding interactions in community spaces as well as external channels like social media. Violating these terms may lead to a temporary or permanent ban.

### 3. Temporary Ban

**Community Impact**: A serious violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior.

**Consequence**: A temporary ban from any sort of interaction or public communication with the community for a specified period of time. No public or private interaction with the people involved, including unsolicited interaction with those enforcing the Code of Conduct, is allowed during this period. Violating these terms may lead to a permanent ban.

### 4. Permanent Ban

**Community Impact**: Demonstrating a pattern of violation of community standards, including sustained inappropriate behavior, harassment of an individual, or aggression toward or disparagement of classes of individuals.

**Consequence**: A permanent ban from any sort of public interaction within the community.

## Educational-Specific Guidelines

### üéì For Learners

- **Ask questions freely** - no question is too basic
- **Share your learning journey** - others can learn from your experience
- **Be patient with yourself** - neural networks are complex topics
- **Help others when you can** - teaching reinforces your own learning
- **Respect different learning paces** - everyone learns differently

### üë®‚Äçüè´ For Educators and Mentors

- **Be patient and encouraging** - remember your first time learning these concepts
- **Explain concepts clearly** - avoid jargon when possible
- **Provide context** - help learners understand why concepts matter
- **Encourage experimentation** - hands-on learning is powerful
- **Celebrate progress** - acknowledge improvements and milestones

### üíª For Contributors

- **Write clear documentation** - help others understand your code
- **Be welcoming to new contributors** - everyone was new once
- **Provide constructive feedback** - help others improve
- **Share knowledge generously** - contribute to collective learning
- **Maintain educational focus** - remember this is a learning tool

## Positive Community Examples

### üåü Great Ways to Contribute

**Helping with Learning**:
- "Great question! Let me explain how backpropagation works step by step..."
- "I struggled with this concept too. Here's what helped me understand it..."
- "Your implementation is close! Try adjusting the learning rate and see what happens."

**Code Reviews**:
- "Nice work on this feature! Consider adding a docstring to explain the algorithm."
- "This is a good start. Here are some suggestions to make it more efficient..."
- "I love how you visualized this concept! It really helps with understanding."

**Community Support**:
