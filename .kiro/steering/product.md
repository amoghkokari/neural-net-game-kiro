# Product Overview

## Neural Network Adventure RPG

An educational RPG game that teaches neural network concepts through interactive storytelling, quiz-based boss battles, and hands-on coding challenges. Players join Alex and their AI companion Tensor on a quest to master neural networks from basic concepts to building GPT from scratch.

## Core Learning Journey

The game follows a structured progression through 17 levels across 5 arcs:
- **Foundation Arc**: Basic concepts (neurons, weights, bias, activation functions)
- **Building Arc**: Network construction (perceptrons, forward/backward propagation)
- **Training Arc**: Real-world application (datasets, overfitting prevention)
- **Advanced Arc**: Specialized architectures (RNN, CNN, LSTM, GRU)
- **Transformer Arc**: Modern AI (attention mechanisms, GPT)

## Key Features

- **Interactive Visualizations**: Real-time neural network rendering with parameter adjustment
- **Quiz-Based Boss Battles**: Time-pressured knowledge tests that reward speed and accuracy
- **Educational Challenges**: Step-by-step learning with immediate feedback
- **Progressive Mastery**: Understanding-based progression system
- **Character Development**: Alex grows stronger with each victory
- **Retry System**: Learn from mistakes with instant retry options

## Boss Battle System

- **Knowledge-Based Combat**: Answer neural network questions under time pressure
- **Speed Rewards**: Faster correct answers earn more progress points
- **Timeout Penalties**: Boss gains advantage when players run out of time
- **Retry Mechanics**: Clean defeat screens with immediate retry options
- **Educational Focus**: Battles test understanding, not reflexes

## Target Audience

Developers and students wanting to learn neural networks through engaging, interactive gameplay rather than traditional tutorials or textbooks.
